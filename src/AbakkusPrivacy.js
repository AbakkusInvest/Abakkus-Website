						<Heading subtitle>California Online Privacy Protection Act</Heading>

						<p>
							CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
							websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's
							reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or
							company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
							operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information
							from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on
							its website stating exactly the information being collected and
							those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See
							more at:
							http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
						</p>
						<br />

						<ol>
							<li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
							<li>
								Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on
								our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page
								after entering our website.
							</li>
							<li>
								Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can
								easily be found on the page specified above.

						</ol>
						<br />

							COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)
						</Heading>

						<p>
							When it comes to the collection of personal information from
							children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online
							Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The
							Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection
							agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators
							of websites and online services must do to protect children's
							privacy and safety online.
						</p>
						<br />

						<p>
							We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13
							years old.

						<br />
						<Heading subtitle>Fair Information Practices</Heading>

						<p>
							The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
							privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include
							have played a significant role in the development of data
							protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
							Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented
							is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
							personal information.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will
							take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
						</p>
						<li>We will notify you via email within 7 business days</li>
						<br />
						<p>
							We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires
							that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
							rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere
							to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
							enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
							have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
							and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.

						<br />
						<Heading subtitle>CAN SPAM Act</Heading>

							The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial
							email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives
							recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to
							them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>

							Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our
							clients after the original transaction has occurred.
